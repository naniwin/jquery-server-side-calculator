## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

- This is a server side calculator project. Some of the problems that I ran into was understanding GET and POST using ajax. Even going through the lecture notes wasn't enough so I did my own research and practice small projects I found online to write out /GET and /Post codes. I believe I have a strong grasp of it.
- Another issue was making the code to do the calculation in server.js
- I did additional research on this as well over the weekend. I wish I could have asked my classmates on Slack however I was out of town from Thursday until late Saturday. So most of my homework and research started on Sunday. I didn't want to ask on Slack right off the bat without trying to attempt it myself.
